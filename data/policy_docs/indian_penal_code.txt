The Indian Penal Code (IPC) includes several key provisions aimed at curbing hate speech and maintaining communal harmony in the country. **Section 153A** of the IPC prohibits actions that promote enmity between different groups on the basis of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, or other such grounds. This section also covers any act that is prejudicial to the maintenance of public harmony, whether by words, signs, or visible representations. The primary intent is to prevent inflammatory content that could disturb peace between communities.

**Section 295A** further strengthens this by criminalizing deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class of citizens. This includes insulting or attempting to insult the religion or religious beliefs of any group through speech, writing, signs, or visible representations. The section is designed to protect religious sentiments and prevent incitement of religious hostility under the pretext of free expression.

**Section 505** of the IPC deals with statements, rumors, or reports that could lead to public mischief. Specifically, it prohibits the publication or circulation of statements that promote or create enmity, hatred, or ill-will between different classes or communities. It also criminalizes statements that incite the public to commit offenses against the state or disturb public tranquility.

Together, these sections of the IPC aim to preserve public order and safeguard communal harmony by penalizing speech and actions that could lead to inter-group conflict, religious discord, or societal unrest. Violations can lead to imprisonment, fines, or both, depending on the severity of the offense and its impact on public peace.
