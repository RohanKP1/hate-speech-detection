The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, but hate speech that incites imminent lawless action is not protected.
Federal hate crime laws enhance penalties for crimes motivated by bias against race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
Title VII prohibits employment discrimination and harassment based on protected characteristics.
