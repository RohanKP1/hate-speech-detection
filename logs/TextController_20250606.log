2025-06-06 01:58:43,178 | INFO     | TextController | Policy reasoning result: The content "fuck off" has been classified as "Toxic" based on a comprehensive analysis of relevant content moderation policies and the nature of the phrase itself. Below is a detailed explanation of the classification:

### 1. Reference to Specific Policies

The classification of the phrase as "Toxic" aligns with several content moderation policies from different platforms and legal frameworks:

- **Meta Policy**: This policy prohibits content that creates a hostile environment and is abusive. The phrase "fuck off" is clearly abusive and can be interpreted as an intent to offend, which violates Meta's guidelines against hate speech and harassment.

- **Reddit Policy**: Reddit's policies explicitly prohibit harassment, bullying, and threatening behavior. The phrase in question can be perceived as a form of verbal aggression, which falls under the category of harassment and is therefore subject to removal.

- **Google Policy**: Google's policies against promoting hatred or inciting violence are relevant here. While "fuck off" may not directly incite violence, it does promote a hostile interaction, which is contrary to Google's standards for respectful communication.
