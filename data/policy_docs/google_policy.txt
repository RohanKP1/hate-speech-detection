Google's hate speech policy strictly prohibits any content that promotes hatred, incites violence, or encourages discrimination against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. The policy applies across all Google platforms, including YouTube, Google Ads, Blogger, and the Google Play Store. Content that dehumanizes others, incites violence, or promotes harmful stereotypes is explicitly banned. This includes calling specific groups inferior, advocating for exclusion or segregation, mocking victims of atrocities, or glorifying hate groups and ideologies such as white supremacy or religious extremism.

Additionally, Google does not allow content that encourages or instructs on carrying out violent or extremist acts, including terrorism-related materials or ideologically driven violence. Even when content is shared under the guise of humor, satire, or artistic expression, it must not propagate hate or cause harm. Context is carefully evaluated, and exceptions may apply for educational, documentary, or newsworthy purposes if the intent is clearly to inform rather than incite.

Violations of the policy can lead to a range of consequences, including content removal, account suspension, demonetization, or permanent bans. Google also provides tools for users to report hate speech and offers an appeals process if content is removed in error. This comprehensive policy reflects Google's commitment to fostering safe, respectful, and inclusive digital spaces.
