Reddit's hate speech policy clearly prohibits any content that promotes hate based on a personâ€™s identity or inherent vulnerability. This includes, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and disability. Reddit strives to maintain a safe and respectful environment for all users, and as such, any post, comment, or message that targets individuals or groups based on these characteristics is considered a violation of its rules.

Content that incites or glorifies violence, dehumanizes individuals, or advocates for segregation or exclusion based on identity is subject to removal. Such violations are treated seriously and can result in temporary or permanent bans from the platform. Reddit also takes a firm stance against harassment and bullying. Threatening behavior, repeated personal attacks, or any form of targeted abuse toward other users can lead to immediate account suspension, regardless of whether the behavior occurs in public forums or private messages.

The platform relies on a combination of automated tools, community moderation, and site-wide enforcement teams to identify and act on violations. Users are encouraged to report harmful content, and Reddit empowers individual communities (subreddits) to establish their own rules in alignment with site-wide policies. Through these mechanisms, Reddit aims to protect free expression while firmly opposing hate and abuse.
